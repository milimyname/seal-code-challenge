## My Challenges

I'm glad for this project because it made me realise that I cannot rely upload files on a database (it's possible though).
1. First Approach
I used some fordmidable package to help me upload files to my current folder. I thought it'll work the same way in production but not.
2. AWS Approach
Setup is complicated and this project doesn't need to take this type of system. I tried it but it got complicated. I'll use it for another project of mine.
3. Firebase Approach
nothing new. I'd have done it at first. It's cool to work with it. Ideal for small projects. Not to forget about a shareable link. I used there a jswon web token which helped me with auth in the past. 

I hope you liked the result. I'm open to changes and qs! Feel free to tell me.
